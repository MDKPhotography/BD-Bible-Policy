## 🔔 Important Reminders

> **"With proper controls in place, there should be no need for emails with dozens of people on cc. All questions on compliance or schedule go through the Proposal Manager for resolution."**

> **"The Proposal Manager is responsible for compliance and schedule regardless of Prime or Sub status."**

> **"Reviewers must NOT be the writers - independent review is critical for quality."**

> **"The Blue Team Review is one of the most critical reviews - it ensures writers are going in the right direction before they go too far."**
