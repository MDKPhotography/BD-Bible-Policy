> **"The Proposal Manager is responsible for compliance and schedule regardless of Prime or Sub status."**

> **"Reviewers must NOT be the writers - independent review is critical for quality."**

> **"The Blue Team Review is one of the most critical reviews - it ensures writers are going in the right direction before they go too far."**
