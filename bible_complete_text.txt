2.11.1.1	🏆 CUSTOMER ENGAGEMENT BEST PRACTICES
The Golden Rules:
Listen 70%, Talk 30%
Follow up within 24 hours
Bring value every interaction
Document everything immediately
Customer Call Scripts That Work:
Opening That Gets Attention: "Hi [Name], I know you're dealing with [specific challenge from research]. We just helped [similar customer] solve this exact problem. Worth a 20-minute discussion?"
Discovery Questions That Uncover Needs:
"If you had unlimited budget, what would you fix first?"
"What keeps you up at night about this program?"
"How would your boss measure success?"
"Who else loses sleep over this problem?"
Closing That Gets Commitment: "Based on what you've shared, I'd like to bring our technical lead to show you exactly how we'd solve this. Does Tuesday or Thursday work better?"
2.11.1.2	🎯 WIN THEME DEVELOPMENT
The Win Theme Formula: Customer Pain + Our Unique Solution + Proof = Win Theme
Examples of Powerful Win Themes:
✅ STRONG:
Speed: "While competitors study the problem for 6 months, we deliver working prototypes in 30 days - just like we did for NAVAIR."
Experience: "Our team wrote the original system in 2018, maintained it for 5 years, and knows every line of code - no learning curve."
Innovation: "University research + rapid prototyping = solutions that don't exist anywhere else."
❌ WEAK:
"We provide excellent customer service"
"We are committed to quality"
"We have extensive experience"
